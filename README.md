## Objective

The objective of this project is to understand investment patterns and provide actionable insights for optimizing investment strategies. This dashboard helps financial analysts and investors gain a deeper understanding of investment behaviors and trends.

Throughout this project, I've had the chance to:
- Dive deep into investment data to uncover valuable insights.
- Develop interactive dashboards to visualize key investment metrics.
- Provide data-driven recommendations for strategic decision-making.

## Dataset Used

The dataset was sourced from an Excel worksheet named "Investment Model Dataset". It contains information about gender, age, investment avenues, mutual funds, equity market, debentures, government bonds, fixed deposits, PPF, gold, stock market, factors, objectives, purposes, durations, investment monitors, expected avenues, savings objectives, reasons for equity, mutual funds, bonds, fixed deposits, and sources.

## Steps Followed

### Data Gathering
- **Importing Data**: Importing the Excel file into Power BI and transforming it in the Power Query Editor for initial cleaning and data processing.

### Data Cleaning
- **Removing Empty Columns**: Removing empty columns.
- **Eliminating Duplicates and Errors**: Correcting duplicates and errors.
- **Value Replacement**: Replacing values in columns with proper naming conventions.
- **Setting Data Types**: Detecting and setting the appropriate data types for each column using the auto-detect feature in Power Query Editor.

### Data Processing
- **Creating New Columns**: Using the conditional column feature in Power Query Editor to create new columns.
- **KPI Creation**: Utilizing the new columns to create various KPIs and charts.

### Data Analysis
- **Visualization Tools**: Utilizing various charts and visualizations to present data comprehensively.
    - **Donut Chart**: Showing individuals by investment avenues.
    - **Donut Chart**: Showing individuals by saving objectives.
    - **Clustered Column Chart**: Showing the sum of equity market, government bonds, and mutual funds by gender.
    - **Clustered Bar Chart**: Showing avenues by objective.
    - **Clustered Bar Chart**: Showing avenues by sources.
    - **Clustered Column Chart**: Showing avenues by duration.
    - **Clustered Column Chart**: Showing avenues by investment monitor.
    - **Cards**: Showing average age, female, and male.
    - **Slicer**: Showing avenues and reasons for mutual funds.

## Tasks

- **Task 1 (Data Exploration and Summary)**: Objective - Understand and summarize key statistics in the dataset.
- **Task 2 (Gender-Based Analysis)**: Objective - Analyze and visualize gender-based differences in investment preferences.
- **Task 3 (Objective Analysis)**: Objective - Analyze the relationship between saving objectives and investment objectives.
- **Task 4 (Investment Duration and Summary)**: Objective - Analyze investment durations and monitoring frequencies.
- **Task 5 (Reasons for Investment)**: Objective - Analyze and visualize the reasons for investment.
- **Task 6 (Source of Information)**: Objective - Analyze the sources from which individuals gather investment information.
- **Task 7 (Final Dashboard)**: Objective - Create a comprehensive final dashboard incorporating all insights.

## Key Questions of the Dashboard

- What are the main investment avenues chosen by individuals?
- What are the common saving objectives?
- How do investment preferences differ by gender?
- What are the main objectives for different investment avenues?
- How does the duration of investment vary across different avenues?
- What are the primary reasons for choosing different investment types?
- What are the main sources of investment information?

## Learned About

- **Calculated Fields**: For creating new measures such as summing up different investment types.
- **Matrix Tables**: To show comprehensive data in a tabular format.
- **Visualizations**: Donut charts, pie charts, bar charts, and cluster charts.
- **KPIs and Slicers**: Key Performance Indicators and slicers for filtering data dynamically.
- **Filters**: Used to filter data according to various dimensions such as investment avenues and reasons for mutual funds.

## Key Insights Summary

- **Investment Avenues**: Visualized through donut charts to show distribution by different avenues.
- **Saving Objectives**: Donut charts provide insights into common saving objectives.
- **Gender-Based Analysis**: Clustered column charts highlight gender-based differences in investment preferences.
- **Objective Analysis**: Clustered bar charts reveal the relationship between investment avenues and objectives.
- **Duration and Monitoring**: Clustered column charts show investment durations and monitoring frequencies.
- **Reasons for Investment**: Analyzed and visualized to understand why individuals choose specific investments.
- **Sources of Information**: Clustered bar charts identify the main sources from which individuals gather investment information.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Power BI**: Ensure Power BI Desktop is installed.
2. **Dataset**: Download the "Investment Model Dataset" Excel file and save it locally.
3. **Import Data**: Open Power BI, import the dataset, and load it into Power Query Editor.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Follow the data cleaning, processing, and analysis steps outlined above to recreate the dashboard.

## Usage

- Open the Power BI file.
